# rocksdbffm

**rocksdbffm** is a Java wrapper for [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) **v10.10.1** using the **Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API** (Project Panama).

The project aims to provide a more maintainable alternative to the traditional JNI-based `rocksdbjni`.
The target is JDK 25+ because of `java.lang.foreign`.

The native library is built from the RocksDB source via **`zig cc` / `zig c++`** as a drop-in C/C++ compiler (`PORTABLE=1 make shared_lib`). Zig bundles clang and libc++ for every target, enabling hermetic cross-compilation without a separate sysroot or system toolchain.

## Why This Project Exists

### 1. Inspired by community work

Especially this post [Expanding RocksDB’s Java FFI](https://rocksdb.org/blog/2024/02/20/foreign-function-interface.html).

### 2. Reducing JNI Maintenance Lag
There is often a significant delay between new features appearing in the RocksDB C++ core and their availability in
the Java JNI wrappers. This is largely due to the complexity of maintaining C++ glue code. By using FFM, we can map
C headers directly in Java, simplifying the process of supporting new C++ features.

The code is mechanically generated, and it can be inspected easily (as it is normal Java code).

### 3. Safety

FFM is much more safe than JNI: memory errors are not crashing the whole JVM.

### 4. Performance through Zero-Copy

Exposing `MemorySegment` methods:
- **Pinnable Slices:** Utilizes `rocksdb_get_pinned`
- **MemorySegment & ByteBuffer:** Support for `java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment` and direct `ByteBuffer` for data transfer between Java and native code.


## Performance Results

Benchmarks performed on JDK 25 (Apple M-series), RocksDB v10.10.1, compared to JNI (`DirectByteBuffer` tier):

| Operation | FFM (ops/s) | JNI (ops/s) | Gain |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Reads | 2,905,778 | 1,905,202 | **+52%** |
| Writes | 688,503 | 590,209 | **+17%** |
| Batch writes (100 ops) | 23,982 | 16,532 | **+45%** |

*Both libraries use `PinnableSlice` for reads. The gains come from lower FFM downcall overhead vs JNI (no frame setup, no thread-state transitions, JIT-compiled stubs). Write gains are smaller because WAL/memtable I/O dominates. Batch write gains multiply because overhead is paid 100× per iteration.*

### Running benchmarks

```bash
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```

Builds everything, runs both FFM and JNI suites, and prints a side-by-side comparison table.

## Design Choices

Several deliberate decisions set this library apart from `rocksdbjni`.

### Modern Java
Requires JDK 25+. The API uses `java.lang.foreign` (FFM), records, sealed types, and pattern matching where they reduce boilerplate or improve safety. There is no legacy compatibility shim.

### Exceptions for all errors
Every operation that can fail throws `RocksDBException` (an unchecked exception). `rocksdbjni` historically returned `null`, `-1`, or relied on status objects that callers could silently ignore. Here a failure is always loud.

### Domain primitives instead of raw scalars
Raw numeric types carry no unit information and cannot be validated at construction time.

| Concept | rocksdbjni | rocksdbffm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cache / buffer sizes | `long` (bytes, silently) | `MemorySize.ofMB(64)` |
| Snapshot position | `long` | `SequenceNumber` |

Both types are immutable, `Comparable`, and reject invalid values at construction — an illegal value cannot be created and therefore cannot be passed anywhere.

### `Path` for filesystem operations
All methods that accept a filesystem location (open, checkpoint, backup, …) take `java.nio.file.Path` instead of `String`. This prevents confusion between absolute and relative paths, integrates naturally with the NIO file API, and rules out accidentally passing non-path strings.

## Development Approach

This is a heavily AI-driven project. We intend to continue using AI as a cornerstone of our development process, from mapping C headers to optimizing the FFM implementation.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- JDK 25+.
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (any 0.15.x build).

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build RocksDB from the submodule (first time or after a clean)
mvn generate-resources -Pnative-build

# Run unit tests
mvn test
```

## License
This project is licensed under the same terms as RocksDB (LevelDB/Apache 2.0).

## Contributing

The project is open to contributions, particularly in the following areas:
- Implementing missing RocksDB C API features in Java.
- Benchmarking and performance profiling of the Java-to-Native boundary.
- Improving the safety and lifecycle management of native objects.

## TODO

- Create a community around this project with the intent to merge it back into rocksdb.
- If that fails and community is aligned:
  - Run it as separated project (like rust-rocksdb).
  - Deploy to maven central.
- Cover all features of RocksDB in idiomatic Java.
- Provide a pool for MemorySegment/ByteBuffer to make the library more
  "battery included".
- Add arena-accepting overloads to the `byte[]` API tier (Zig-style caller-owned allocator):
  `db.put(arena, key, value)` / `db.get(arena, key)` / `db.delete(arena, key)`.
  Lets callers amortize arena create/destroy over a batch of calls instead of paying it per call.
